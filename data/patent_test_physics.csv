Upon application, the carrier solvent/reactant evaporates, allowing polymerization of the remaining solution constituents to form a non-toxic, hydrophobic, elastomeric polyureathane linked copolymer that provides a long-term barrier against rot, environmental, termite and mold/fungus attack. Complete polymer impregnation of the wood';s interstitial fiber space enables the hydrophobic property of the polymer to provide a long-time barrier to water penetration. Alternatively, the polymer may be surface applied to provide both protection and to prevent leaching out of CCA chemicals in the case of conventionally treated wood.
