20130619,"CN-103160597-A","Molecular biology method for predicating bouncing potentials of excellent ice-snow sportsmen","The invention discloses a molecular biology method for predicating the bouncing potentials of excellent ice-snow sportsmen, wherein the 577R alleles of ACTN3 (alpha-actinin-3 genes) genes are dominant alleles for strength quality and speed quality, various researches on a resistance training effect show that the training sensitivities of R allele carriers are higher, and the close relation between the polymorphisms of the ACTN3 genes and the strength quality is incontrovertible; additionally, I alleles in ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) genome may also be the genes related to the strength quality. According to the molecular biology method disclosed by the invention, the bouncing potentials of the ice-snow sportsmen are predicated by determining the R/X polymorphism of ACTN3 genotype and the I/D polymorphism of ACE genotype in the blood source genomic DNAs (deoxyribonucleic acid) of the ice-snow sportsmen, namely, ACTN3-RR type groups having the ACE genes which are homozygous insertion (II) type are selected. The molecular biology method disclosed by the invention can be used for early selection for the excellent ice-snow sportsmen.","Biology"
