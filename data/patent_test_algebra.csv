The method may include receiving an input statement associated with the arithmetic or algebraic problem. The method may also include determining whether each sentence within a plurality of sentences associated with the input statement is a well-formed sentence from a mathematical perspective. The method may further include converting each statement into a well-formed sentence based on the determining whether each sentence within a plurality of sentences associated with the input statement is a well-formed sentence from a mathematical perspective. Additionally, the method may include converting each well-formed sentence into a mathematical equation to form a set of equations. Also, the method may include solving the set of equations to compute a mathematical result. The method may include narrating the mathematical result in natural language.","Algebra"
