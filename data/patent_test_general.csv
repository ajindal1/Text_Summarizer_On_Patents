The apparatus is capable of bifurcating the buoyancy force into a first component used to compress the gas necessary to sustain the vertical oscillation cycle of a moving vessel, and a second component that drives a means for converting energy. The apparatus generally comprises a moving vessel, a gas compression means, a force transfer means, a conduit, and a force recovery means. In use, the submerged moving vessel receives compressed gas so that the moving vessel';s buoyancy force becomes greater than its downward gravitational force, and the moving vessel begins to rise through the water. As the moving vessel reaches the top of its upstroke, the moving vessel releases the gas, thus causing the moving vessel to sink. The first component of the buoyancy force is transmitted from the moving vessel, through the force transfer means, to the gas compression means, where it is used to compress the gas. The compressed gas is then channeled through the conduit where it is retained by the charging valve while the moving vessel sinks in the water. When the moving vessel reaches the bottom of its down stroke, the charging valve releases the compressed gas from the conduit into the moving vessel, and the moving vessel';s vertical oscillation cycle begins to repeat. The second component of the buoyancy force is captured by a force transfer means and directed to an energy conversion means, where it is converted to useable energy. Thus, the vertical oscillation of the moving vessel produces useable energy.","General"

The invention first determines the average programming state (corresponding to an average threshold voltage level) for the set of data which is to be programmed into the memory cells. This is accomplished by counting the number of programming states which must be traversed in programming the cells with the data. If the majority of the data requires programming the memory cell(s) to the upper two programming states (in the case of a two bit per cell or four state system), then the data is inverted and stored in the memory in the inverted form. This reduces the amount of programming time, the number of programming states traversed, and the power consumed in programming the memory cell(s) with the data field. In the case of data which is encoded using a scheme other than a direct sequential ordering of the threshold voltage levels, the encoded data is converted into an alternate form prior to counting the states. A flag indicating the translation operation (inversion of states, reassignment of states to different levels, etc.) used to assign the existing threshold voltage levels to those that will be programmed into the memory cells is also stored. The flag can be used to indicate the transformation process needed to convert the stored data back to its original form.","General"

20110224,"US-2011046699-A1","Self-regulating transcutaneous energy transfer","A rechargeable battery system and method are disclosed, in which an implantable medical device (IMD) regulates its transfer of energy from a separate charger unit. For recharging, a charger unit is brought into proximity to the implanted device. An oscillating current is generated in a primary coil, located in the charger. By inductive coupling through an oscillating magnetic field, an alternating current is generated in a secondary coil, which is implanted in or near the implanted device. The alternating current then passes through a half-wave or full-wave rectifier to form a one-sided current, then passes through a regulator to form an essentially direct current, which is in turn directed to the rechargeable battery in the implanted device. The secondary coil has a controllable damped resonant frequency, which can be dynamically tuned away from the driving frequency of the primary coil by a variable resistor and/or by varying a duty cycle of a rapidly switched electrical element. If a control loop in the implant senses that more power is being received at the second coil than is actually being used to recharge the battery, the control loop temporarily changes the variable resistance. When this happens, the resonant frequency of the secondary coil is detuned slightly away from the driving frequency, so that less of the incoming power is absorbed by the secondary coil. Alternatively, the secondary coil may be temporarily short-circuited. With less or no excess power entering the circuitry of the implant, the problem of overheating is mitigated.","General"

19991005,"US-5961354-A","Electrical connector assembly","Electrical connectors for electrically and physically connecting cable conductors to mating connectors frequently require precise and demanding assembly in order to produce a required level of crosstalk. In many instances, this level must be a set amount, rather than the lowest level possible, in order to match a canceling crosstalk being produced in the mating connector. The present invention is a crossover lead frame connector which reduces the demands upon the assembler in assembling the connector and cable, and yet still provides the precise level of crosstalk required in the connector. These advantages are realized by the use of a crossover lead frame structure which controls the physical length and routing of the signals between the cable conductors and connector pins. This allows the manufacturer to match the connector to the layout of the cable conductors and fix the level of crosstalk that will be produced at the time the connector is manufactured.","General"

This method results in eliminating network crossover costs that would accrue when using different communications networks for setting up calls. For utilizing the call redirecting function, the second subscriber (B) shares in the saved network transition costs by receiving a bonus resulting from the saved network crossover costs. In order to simplify the utilization of the call redirecting function, a device is assigned to the second subscriber (B) that, when activated, automatically initiates a control call for activating the switchover function.","General"

20040210,"US-6689062-B1","Method and apparatus for transesophageal cardiovascular procedures","A minimally invasive approach implementing the concept of transesophageal access to the heart and surrounding structures is described which allows intra and extra cardiac procedures to be performed while the heart is beating. The technique creates a short, wide and almost straight tubular access to the posterior mediastinum, pericardial space and interior of the heart through a penetration in a segment in the GI tract preferably the esophagus in proximity to a cardiac chamber. The access device isolates the penetration site from the rest of the esophageal lumen and secures the penetration site in the esophageal wall. Other means are used to secure the penetration field in the esophageal wall and prevent micro leakage, including circumferential pressure isolation of the esophageal segment, continuous intra esophageal suction and irrigation, and vacuum negative pressure throughout the procedure. The invention allows for combining transesophageal, epicardial and intracardiac ultrasound images to create stereoscopic high-resolution image for monitoring and controlling the procedure(s).","General"

The alignment device is part of a delivery assembly slidably disposed in a handle.","General"
20120202,"US-2012023632-A1","Hand protecting device","A gripping pad for supporting and protecting the hand of a weightlifter or other user performing an activity that is strenuous to the hand. The gripping pad cushions the junction of the fingers and palm without constricting flexibility or airflow to the skin. Constructed of flexible resilient material, the glove has polymer gel cushions that cushions the palm of the hand and the intermediate phalanges without affecting finger articulation. The bottom surface of the gripping pad has increased friction characteristics.","General"
