The energy for this comes from the thermal energy in the current source, and the device gets cooler.","Electrical"

The intercalation process may use gaseous, liquid or solid components to form conductive contacts to the silicon structures of the porous silicon. The intensity of the light emitted by porous silicon layers and devices can therefore be increased by the improved electrical interconnection between the mechanically, chemically and thermally fragile porous silicon and the device electrodes. The intercalation process uses conductive materials that interpenetrate the structures of the porous silicon thereby providing the improved electrical properties. Increasing the surface area over which electrical contact is made increases the junction area which allows increased electrical current flow across the junction. The increased electrical current flow across the junction provides an increased number of electrical charge carriers undergoing radiative recombination. Increased device efficiency is therefore provided as the number of emitted photons (corresponding to the optical brightness of the device) is proportional to the electrical charge carriers undergoing radiative recombination.","Electrical"

Said method is based on thermodynamic phase transformation of some solid materials within a very narrow temperature range, e.g. the shape memory effect (SME) or the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). According to the invention, a gradient-type shift of the transformation temperature is set in a fixed manner along the axis of thermal flow by modifying the material properties, and the partial segments having a higher transformation temperature are arranged on the hot side while the partial segments having a lower transformation temperature are arranged on the cold side, said arrangement being as linear as possible or finely graduated. The greater the ratio is between the range of operating temperatures and transformation hysteresis, the easier it is to increase efficiency compared to gas circulation processes by recovering heat between the individual segments as a result of thermal oscillations in the area of material-related hysteresis. Water pumps can be operated with the aid of solar power or lost cooling heat by using serially disposed tube segments ( 1   a - 1   f ) made of slightly different NiTi (nitinol)-based SME metal alloys. Changes in the magnetic flow can be excited and be utilized for inducing electrical power proportionate to the thermal flow in stacked layers made of ferromagnetic alloys (e.g. MnFeAsP).","Electrical"
