Powder coating reduces breaches in the protective layer. Powder coating may be adapted to withstand high temperatures so as to make them suitable for use in harsh operating environments. One such environment can be found in the processing of flue gas from fossil burning power generators, where the flue gas has a relatively high temperature and high sulfur content.","General"

The patterns are machined in complex shapes that cannot be extracted from reusable, two-piece pattern molds. The patterns are machined in a basic, programmed, five-axis machining process to form multiple copies of a complex pattern body. The process is modified to produce multiple copies of a modified design. Multiple bit patterns of variable forms are produced without an intermediate, reusable pattern mold that requires multiple mold pieces, thus eliminating the time and expense in variation of the bit design. The pattern is machined in a single chucking operation in a machine tool adapted for machining plastics in a three-dimensional global process. The plastic composition and density permit it to be machined into a pattern having relatively small, unsupported structural projections and smooth surface features. Bit patterns formed in the process have forward canted blades that are machined from mating planar surfaces to simplify the machining process. The edges of the forward canted blades form a spiral surface for mounting cutter elements. The forward canting makes the blades stronger and permits the blades to be thinner than non-canted blades to increase the clearance between blades, which improves the movement of cuttings. Recesses are machined into the pattern gauge face to produce a recess in the casting for receiving hardfacing. The hardfacing forms a layer that cooperates with the surrounding blade material to form a smooth transition area as the bit wears.","General"

This choice in bit patterns is primarily for use in reducing the low frequency content of the bit pattern. However, some of the choice available may be used for other purposes, such as ensuring the same bit pattern is not always used. The second technique is to vary the point in the bit pattern at which writing begins. This is possible in a ROM type format because the new data are written in exactly the same location as the old data. Therefore, if the old data are exactly the same as the new data, it is optional whether or not to overwrite the old data. Note that typically the header information for old and new data is the same. Accordingly, this opportunity for varying the location of where writing begins is available even when the new user data are completely different from the older data.","General"

Enrichment to highly concentrated fractions is hindered by the enormous number of components involved, the very low volatility, the very low solubility of many of the compounds in organic solvents, and the high viscosity of the mixtures to be processed. Starting materials for the new process are enriched fractions of tocochromanols (about 20 to about 50 wt.-%) and/or carotenoids (about 10 to 30 wt.-%) from palm oil obtained by conventional processes, or by counter current multistage processes with supercritical carbon dioxide. These processes, not addressed here, may comprise: Removal of free fatty acids, transesterification of the triglycerides to methyl or ethyl esters, removal of the esters, e.g. by short path distillation, separation of the tocochromanol fraction from the carotenoid fraction by cooling. In the new process, fractions derived from crude palm oil, already enriched to some extent in tocochromanols, carotenoids, phytosterols, and others, are being treated by supercritical fluid technology in a unique combination of counter current separation with selective adsorption and desorption using supercritical fluids. A first enrichment, comprising one or more separation steps by application of a near critical or a supercritical fluid in a single or multistage (counter current) separation process is combined appropriately with a second enrichment step wherein the product of the first enrichment step is directly adsorbed on an adsorbent (silicagel) by passing the product flow over a fixed bed of adsorbent without substantial pressure change, and subsequent desorption with the same (or an other) near critical or supercritical fluid at the same or a different pressure as in the first separation, or by a pre-designed sequence of pressures and temperatures. For the tocochromanol enrichment, carbon dioxide at near critical conditions above the critical temperature of carbon dioxide is used. For the carotenoid enrichment, propane at near critical conditions below the critical temperature of propane is used.","General"

20020711,"WO-0161490-A3","Abstraction of configurable processor functionality for operating systems portability","A hardware abstraction layer operates as a system architectural layer between a real-time operating system and an underlying configurable processor. The hardware abstraction layer provides an abstraction of processor-specific functionality to the operating system. In particular, it abstracts configurable processor features visible to the operating system to provide a uniform, standardized interface between the opeating system and the configurable processor on which it runs. Thus, an operating system running on top of the hardware abstration layer will work on all configurations of the processor which differ from one another only in the configuration parameters covered by the hardware abstraction layer. The hardware abstraction layer may be generated using the same information that is used to describe the features being configured in the configurable processor. Automatic generation of the HAL greatly eases use of the HAL and the configurable processor, since the user is not required to manually write the HAL or adapt an existing one based on the processor configuration parameters.","Operating Systems"

Thin sample bands improve the resolution of microchannel separation processes, as well as many other processes requiring precise control of sample size and volume. The new method comprises a series of steps in which a species sample is manipulated by controlled transport through a junction formed at the intersection of four or more channels. A sample is first inserted into the end of one of these channels in the vicinity of the junction. Next, this sample is thinned by transport across the junction one or more times. During these thinning steps, flow enters the junction through one of the channels and exists through those remaining, providing a divergent flow field that progressively stretches and thins the band with each traverse of the junction. The thickness of the resulting sample band may be smaller than the channel width. Moreover, the thickness of the band may be varied and controlled by altering the method alone, without modification to the channel or junction geometries. The invention is applicable to both electroosmotic and electrophoretic transport, to combined electrokinetic transport, and to some special cases in which bulk fluid transport is driven by pressure gradients.

Specifically, one embodiment of the present invention utilizes an R-2R resistor ladder circuit having moderate sized resistors to progressively reduce a large magnitude current into a very small magnitude current of accurate size. In this manner, available on-chip circuitry voltage can be used to produce the desired small magnitude of current without utilizing excessively large resistors, which can occupy too much die area. This is advantageous when dealing with specific types of on-chip components and circuitry which require accurate currents having very small magnitudes. For example, it may be desirable to integrate filter components (e.g., capacitors) on-chip together with accompanying phase lock loop (PLL) circuitry. However, smaller sized filter components typically need to be supplied accurate charge pump currents having very small magnitudes in order to produce the desired operational bandwidth. As such, the present invention is able to provide accurate charge pump currents having very small magnitudes for the smaller sized filter components from the available on-chip circuitry voltages.
